# MLB-Ticket-Price-Predictions
Predicting MLB Ticket Prices using Machine Learning Techniques

Scraped MLB season ticket prices for the San Francisco Giants and New York Mets. We used Machine Learning techniques such as Lasso Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest to build a model for future price prediction and selected the best model based on performance with out-of-sample data.

You can find the Jupyter Notebook with the project under MLB_Ticket_Price_Prediction.ipynb. The scraped data is under Giants.json and Mets.json.
